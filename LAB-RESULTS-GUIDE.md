# Lab Results System - How to Use

## Overview
Your clinic management system now has a complete Lab Results management system that shows real data from patient visits. Here's how it works:

## 🔍 Current Status
- **Total Patients:** 3 sample patients created
- **Today's Visits:** 3 visits with lab tests
- **Pending Lab Tests:** 6 lab tests waiting for results
- **Pending Imaging Tests:** 3 X-ray tests waiting for results

## 📋 How to Add Lab Tests to a Visit

### When Creating a New Visit:
1. Go to **Patient Management** → Select a patient → **Add New Visit**
2. Fill in the visit details (complaint, diagnosis, etc.)
3. Scroll down to **"🧪 Lab Tests Ordered"** section
4. Click **"+ Add Lab Test"** button
5. Fill in:
   - **Test Name** (e.g., "Complete Blood Count", "Lipid Panel")
   - **Test Type** (e.g., "Blood Test", "Urine Test")
   - **Notes** (e.g., "Check for infections")
6. Add more tests by clicking **"+ Add Lab Test"** again
7. Similarly, add **Imaging Tests** (X-rays, CT scans, etc.)
8. Save the visit

### Lab Test Fields:
- **Test Name:** What test to perform (CBC, Glucose, etc.)
- **Test Type:** Category of test (Blood, Urine, etc.)
- **Notes:** Additional instructions
- **Status:** Automatically set to "pending"

## 🧪 Managing Lab Results

### Access Lab Results Page:
1. From Dashboard → Click **"Lab Results"** card
2. You'll see all lab tests with status indicators

### Test Statuses:
- **🟡 Pending:** Test ordered, waiting to be performed
- **🔵 In Progress:** Test is being performed
- **🟢 Completed:** Results are ready
- **🟣 Reviewed:** Doctor has reviewed the results

### View/Edit Results:
1. Click the **👁️ View** button for any test
2. Modal opens showing:
   - Patient information
   - Test details
   - Current status
   - Form to enter results

### Update Test Status:

   - **Test Results:** Enter the actual test results
   - **Notes:** Add any observations
   - **Status:** Change from pending → in-progress → completed → reviewed
2. Click **"Save Results"**

## 📊 Dashboard Statistics

Your dashboard now shows **real-time data**:

### Quick Statistics Panel:
- **Total Patients:** Count of all registered patients
- **Today's Visits:** Visits created today
- **Pending Lab Tests:** Lab tests waiting for results
- **Pending X-rays:** Imaging tests waiting for results
- **Today's Appointments:** Scheduled appointments

### Statistics Summary:
- **Daily Activity:** Shows if there are visits today
- **Workload:** Indicates if there are many pending tests (>5 = high workload)
- **Schedule:** Shows appointment status

## 🔧 How the System Works

### Data Storage:
- Lab tests are stored as JSON in the `visits` table
- Each visit can have multiple lab tests and imaging tests
- Status tracking: pending → in-progress → completed → reviewed

### Lab Test Structure:
```json
{
  "test_name": "Complete Blood Count",
  "test_type": "Blood Test",
  "notes": "Check for infections",
  "status": "pending",
  "priority": "normal",
  "normal_range": "WBC: 4.5-11.0",
  "results": "",
  "report_date": null
}
```

## 📝 Sample Data Created

I've created sample data for you to test:

### Patients:
1. **John Doe** - 2 visits with lab tests
2. **Jane Smith** - 1 visit with lab tests
3. **Michael Johnson** - 1 visit with lab tests

### Lab Tests:
- **6 pending tests:** CBC, Lipid Panel (for 3 patients)
- **2 completed tests:** Liver Function, Thyroid Function (for John Doe)
- **3 pending imaging tests:** Chest X-rays

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Start the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Login:** Use `Admin@gmail.com` / `Admin1234`

4. **Test the system:**
   - Check Dashboard statistics (should show real numbers now)
   - Click "Lab Results" to see all tests
   - Try updating test results
   - Create new visits with lab tests

## 💡 Tips

1. **Adding Real Data:** Create new patients and visits with lab tests to see more data
2. **Test Workflow:** pending → in-progress → completed → reviewed
3. **Search & Filter:** Use the search bar and filter tabs in Lab Results page
4. **Real-time Updates:** Dashboard statistics update when you add/modify lab tests

The system is now fully functional with real data! Your dashboard will show actual counts instead of zeros.
